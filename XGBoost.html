    <h2 id="section3">Step 1:Installation</h2>
    <p align="justify">You can easily install XGBoost using the pip command, similar to installing any other Python library. This method of installation ensures that XGBoost is equipped with support for your machine's NVIDIA GPU. Alternatively, if you prefer the CPU-only version, consider opting for the conda-forge distribution. It is recommended to perform the XGBoost installation within a virtual environment to maintain a clean base environment.</p>
    <p align="justify">When running through the tutorial examples, we suggest utilizing a machine with GPU support for optimal performance. If a GPU-enabled machine is not available, you can explore alternatives like DataCamp Workspace or Google Colab. However, if you choose Colab, be aware that it typically includes an older version of XGBoost. To ensure you have the latest version, execute the command pip install --upgrade xgboost within your Colab environment.</p>
    <pre><code>$ pip install --user xgboost</code></pre>
    <p align="justify" class="nospace"><b>CPU only</b></p> 
    <pre><code>$ conda install -c conda-forge py-xgboost-cpu</code></pre>
    <p align="justify" class="nospace"><b>Use NVIDIA GPU</b></p>
    <pre><code>$ conda install -c conda-forge py-xgboost-gpu</code></pre>

    <h2 id="section5">Step 2:Import Libraries</h2>
    <p align="justify">This step imports the necessary libraries. XGBoost is imported as xgb, and other libraries include scikit-learn functions for dataset loading, train-test split, and performance evaluation metrics.</p>
    <pre>
    <code>import xgboost as xgb
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix</code></pre>

    <h2 id="section5">Step 3:Load Iris Dataset</h2>
    <p align="justify">Here, the Iris dataset is loaded using scikit-learn's load_iris function, and features (X) and target labels (y) are extracted.</p>
    <pre>
    <code>iris = load_iris()
X = iris.data
y = iris.target</code></pre>

    <h2 id="section7">Step 4:Split Data into Train and Test Sets</h2>
    <p align="justify">The dataset is split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function. It uses 80% of the data for training (X_train, y_train) and 20% for testing (X_test, y_test).</p>
    <pre>
<code>X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)</code></pre>
    
    <h2 id="section8">Step 5:Create DMatrix</h2>
    <p align="justify">XGBoost uses a specialized data structure called DMatrix. The training and testing sets are converted into DMatrix format.</p>
    <pre>
<code>dtrain = xgb.DMatrix(X_train, label=y_train)
dtest = xgb.DMatrix(X_test, label=y_test)</code></pre>
               
    <h2 id="section9">Step 6: Define Parameters</h2>
    <p align="justify">Parameters for the XGBoost model are defined. This example is set up for a multi-class classification task with three classes. Parameters include the objective function, number of classes, maximum depth of trees, learning rate, and evaluation metric.</p>
    <pre>
<code>params = {
'objective': 'multi:softmax',
'num_class': 3,
'max_depth': 3,
'learning_rate': 0.1,
'eval_metric': 'mlogloss'}</code></pre>

    <h2 id="section10">Step 7: Train the XGBoost Model</h2>
    <p align="justify">The XGBoost model is trained using the xgb.train function. It takes the defined parameters, training data (dtrain), and the number of boosting rounds (num_rounds).</p>
    <pre>
<code>num_rounds = 100
model = xgb.train(params, dtrain, num_rounds)</code></pre>

<h2 id="section11">Step 8: Make Predictions</h2>
<p align="justify">The trained model is used to make predictions on the testing set.</p>
<pre>
<code>predictions = model.predict(dtest)</code></pre>

<h2 id="section11">Step 9: Evaluate the Model</h2>
<p align="justify">The predictions are converted to integers (class labels), and the model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.

    This code demonstrates the complete workflow of loading a dataset, splitting it, training an XGBoost model, making predictions, and evaluating the model's performance on a sample dataset (Iris dataset in this case). You can adapt and modify this code for your specific use case and dataset.</p>
<pre>
<code># Convert predictions to integers (class labels)
predictions = predictions.astype(int)
    
# Evaluate accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')
    
# Print classification report and confusion matrix
print(classification_report(y_test, predictions))
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, predictions))</code></pre>

    <h2 id="section12">XGBoost Use Cases</h2>
